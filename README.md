Here is an updated version of my portfolio I have created in React. Previously, I used CSS, HTML, and bootstrap to create my website. Now, I used that as the base for styling,
but was able to use react instead to produce it. Here you can find some of my favorite projects I have worked on,
links to my LinkedIn, ways to contact me, and a PDF file of my resume. Enjoy!
